# 🌍 Earthquake Detection Simulation

**Powered by Benyas Wondwosen**

Simulates an earthquake detection system using **Python (Pygame)** and optionally an **Arduino vibration sensor**. Features include animated characters, earthquake visual effects, particle debris, and alert sounds.

## 🚀 Features

| Feature                | Description                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔔 Real-time Detection | Detects vibrations via Arduino serial input      |
| 🕺 Animated Character  | Human character reacts to vibrations             |
| 🌐 Visual Effects      | Ground shaking & cracking visuals                |
| 💨 Particle Effects    | Dust and debris particles during earthquake      |
| 🔊 Alert Sound         | Plays alert sound on vibration                   |
| 🎹 Keyboard Control    | S & G keys to simulate vibration without Arduino |

## ⚙️ Requirements

| Component   | Version / Installation                                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🐍 Python   | 3.11+                                                           |
| 🎮 Pygame   | `pip install pygame`                                            |
| 🔌 PySerial | `pip install pyserial`                                          |
| 🖼️ Pillow  | `pip install pillow` (optional, for GIFs/sprites)               |
| 🛠️ Arduino | Optional, with vibration sensor connected to `COM3` @ 9600 baud |

---

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Place `quq.mp3` in the same directory as the script (alert sound).
3. Ensure `assets/` folder exists if adding sprite images.
4. Connect Arduino to `COM3` (or update port in the script).

---

## 🎮 Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python BenuEarthquake_Detection.py
```

### ⌨️ Controls

| Key | Action                                  |
| --- | --------------------------------------- |
| S   | Trigger vibration (simulate earthquake) |
| G   | Stop vibration                          |
| ESC | Exit application                        |

### 🔌 Arduino Input

| Signal | Action            |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| 'S'    | Trigger vibration |
| 'G'    | Stop vibration    |

## 🧩 How It Works

| Component               | Function                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 👤 PhysicalPerson       | Animates humanoid character walking & reacting |
| 🌪️ Emitter             | Generates particle effects (dust/debris)       |
| 🌍 Visual Effects       | Ground cracks & shakes on vibration            |
| 🔊 Audio Alert          | Plays sound when vibration detected            |
| 🔗 Serial Communication | Reads Arduino data to trigger/stop vibration   |

## ⚠️ Notes

* You can test without Arduino using **S/G keys**.
* Ensure `quq.mp3` exists in the script directory for alerts.
* Pygame’s clock updates frames and particle effects in real-time.
